# RESTORATION · PROGRESS TRACKER — UE 5.8 CAMPAIGN
Companion to `AAA_BUILD_PLAN.md`. Work the FIRST unchecked box, top to
bottom. Tick only after the full verification loop. Add sub-boxes freely;
never delete history. (Pre-pivot Godot-era progress is archived at the
bottom — the Godot game is the reference implementation, kept runnable
through Phase 0.)

## PHASE 0 — Unreal Foundation & Core Port
- [x] 0.1 UE project skeleton (ue/Restoration, Lumen+VSM, git hygiene,
      headless launch proven: RESTORATION-PY-OK on UE 5.8.0; disk ~19GB —
      monitor per doctrine)
- [x] 0.2 Automation loop proven: tools/ue_loop.sh runs Blender FBX export
      → headless import (naming law enforced; 1m cube = 100.0uu exactly,
      recorded) → staged Lumen capture via gated init_unreal.py, one
      command, unattended (LOOP-COMPLETE 2026-09-03)
- [x] 0.3 Chum imported (full puppet FBX, 3.08m scale-true, all 30
      materials wired via manifest + direct texture import, MawBlack unlit
      + FurCards masked rebuilt natively) + dark locked-EV capture rig +
      ACCEPTANCE BASELINE archived (docs/telemetry/ue-baselines/). Known
      deltas for 1.8+: tally not yet emissive in UE, fur mottle vs plate,
      hardware tier. LFS deferred: no .uasset tracked in git yet (Content
      generated dirs ignored; revisit when Content assets need versioning)
- [x] 0.3b SODIUM CHECK built (tools/sodium_check.py): contact-sheet mode
      for master materials + --subject mode for baked assets (ball UVs lie
      on bakes — their own mesh tells the truth). First gate run on Chum
      PASSED fur/lens/hardware/whiskers and CAUGHT the un-rebuilt body:
      belly+patches read as faceted clay, hands/feet as wax — findings
      filed against units 1.1 / 1.4 / 1.5
- [x] 0.4 Quixel/Fab hookup: owner signed in; Fab plugin enabled in the
      project; import doctrine + starter shopping list at ue/FAB-IMPORT.md;
      credits ledger at ue/CREDITS-FAB.md. The physical pull is editor-UI
      only (no API) — batched into Phase 3's first room unit, or any time
      the owner spends 5 min in Window→Fab per the doc
- [x] 0.5 Data extraction (tools/extract_data.py, deterministic):
      ue/Restoration/Data/ = Rooms(20) Doors(20, locked reasons intact)
      Stations(5) Monitors(2) DemoOpen(7) Timings(32 constants w/ homes)
      GameText(714 keys from translations/strings.csv). Landmarks: no
      single source table exists — landmarks spawn in code; extract at
      P0 world-stamping when the interactable spawns are ported
- [ ] 0.6 P0 — boot & walk: pawn with Godot-matched feel (player.gd
      constants incl. crouch c045), world stamped FROM the CSVs, doors with
      locked reasons; acceptance: free walk of all twenty rooms
- [ ] 0.6b P1 — SPIKE 2: twelve SceneCapture2D feeds on the monitor wall,
      60fps sustained on this machine, written into the engine memo
- [ ] 0.7 P4a — the Rundown actor: TICK BRAIN (no Behavior Tree, per the
      migration map) with the grammar verbatim; WARN/STRIKE telemetry in
      the identical log format
- [ ] 0.8 P2+P3 — state/saves (v16 SaveGame mirroring _save_dict) + the
      loop (bench capture, schedule clock, Harriet freeze)
- [ ] 0.9 Harness: Gauntlet/functional-test maps, three bots, invariant
      parser reading the same logs; I01/I02/I22/I06 green in UE
- [ ] 0.10 PHASE GATE: parity slice — one room, Chum encounter, saves,
      QA subset green, THE-LAWS spot-audit, captured & reviewed

## PHASE 1 — After-Fire Chum (Blender factory → UE acceptance)
- [ ] 1.1 Torso: quilted patchwork, seams, char zones, 2048 bake
- [ ] 1.2 Throat speaker (donor speaker/radio driver, chest mount, cabling)
- [ ] 1.3 Collar, leather strap, dead brass bell
- [ ] 1.4 Arms & hands: tendons both sides, articulated fingers
- [ ] 1.5 Legs: control rods, torn fur windows, weighted feet
- [ ] 1.6 Tail: segmented core, fur, rust tip
- [ ] 1.7 Full-figure unification + texture/size budget
- [ ] 1.8 Head realism retrofit per §R (staples→maps, sculpted teeth,
      beveled metals, fur density/anisotropy; AF jaw posed SHUT per canon)
- [ ] 1.9 THE POUR: AF locomotion per motion doctrine (linear-dominant
      curves, head-leads single arc, absolute stops, parked-statue idle,
      NO secondary motion, servo eye on its own layer)
- [ ] 1.10 THE FOLD + THE WITHDRAWAL (2.2s doorway montage per door width;
      reverse-exact-path retreat)
- [ ] 1.11 THE PERFORMANCE QUOTE (1.2m loom: frontal square-up + the one
      15° tilt + the jaw worked by his own hand at the lever, arrhythmic —
      and the once-only pre-strike jaw beat: hand, click, open, silence)
- [ ] 1.12 Tally states, eye tracking, throat-speaker room tone wired to AI
      (bell never sounds; no vocalizations; jaw never syncs to sound)
- [ ] 1.13 PHASE GATE: 10-shot gallery + long soak, reviewed

## PHASE 2 — The Cast
- [ ] 2.1 Human pipeline v2 (evaluate MetaHuman vs Blender template in-unit)
- [ ] 2.2 Merle Cottry

## PHASE 3 — The Studio (enumerated from docs/canon/restoration-room-bible.md;
per room: light family per lighting bible, I/L/D object budget, drift hooks,
web tie, Megascans surfaces + Fab/PolyHaven props + bespoke pieces, Lumen
pass, collision/nav, capture review. Dressing is authored FROM
docs/canon/restoration-ambient-lore-ledger.md — the room's ambient lore

static, three-reads compliant. Taxonomy QA each room: QA-55 prompt
discipline, QA-56 drift=dressing-only, QA-57 one hero object max.)

## PHASE 5 — Polish
- [ ] 5.1 Audio bed + foley on anim events (MetaSounds; AUDIO LAW:
      band-limited=memory / full-range=present; S17 footfall, S18 fold,
      occlusion bloom <3m, the wake's band-step-down cut)
- [ ] 5.2 UI/menus/accessibility (controls map: stable inputs, hold=commit,
      real binding glyphs; accessibility matrix R1-R7+ full target)
